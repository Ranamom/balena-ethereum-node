  ## Usage instructions
  **Application download**
  Once you power up your device you'll need to allow some time for it to download the main application, this typically takes a few minutes but it can take more depending on your internet connection.
  **Usage**
  When the download is completed the geth client will start syncing to mainnet. At this point you'll be able to access the grafana dashboard at http://geth or http://geth.local to track sync progress
  and view system metrics.
  Default settings for the client:
  - Sync to mainnet using 'snap' sync.
  - HTTP and WS RCP servers enabled with 'eth,net,web3' namespaces.
