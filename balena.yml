  ## Usage instructions


  **Application download**

  Once you power up your device you'll need to allow some time for it to download the main application, this typically takes a few minutes but it can take more depending on your internet connection.


  **Usage**

  When the download is completed the geth client will start syncing to mainnet. At this point you'll be able to access the grafana dashboard at http://geth or http://geth.local to track sync progress
  and view system metrics. By default the client syncs to mainnet using 'snap' sync and has HTTP and WS RCP servers enabled with 'eth,net,web3' namespaces.


  See the project's [README.md](https://github.com/tmigone/balena-ethereum-node) for details on how to deploy a node with custom configuration.
